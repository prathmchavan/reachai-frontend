# Gmail - OpenAI

Super charge you gmails, with OpenAI


## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xajinkya/gmail-openai.git
```

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="589627228112-p1801rrqugakec80mkhntoj0af6m1r7n.apps.googleusercontent.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="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"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000/login"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL="https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_USERINFO_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_ORG_ID="org-FMK7ofG5e1diOp9LGTkZR3LO"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-fk5k9qpLyP31jjwOAgxQT3BlbkFJdXkZlrlFkR4D5bTAxH0E"
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```

## Usage
To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
To create a production build, run:

```bash
    npm run build
```

To start the production server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, navigate to **localhost:3000**. If you're not logged in, click on **Login Here** to begin the authentication process with Google. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the /login/add-api page where you can paste your **OpenAI API key**. If you proceed to the home page without adding the API key, you'll see an **Add OpenAI API Key** button on homepage.

## Email Classification

Once logged in and authenticated, you'll see a "Classify" button. Clicking this button will categorize your emails into the following categories:

* General
* Important
* Spam
* Promotions
* Marketing
* Social

If your OpenAI API key is **valid** and **not expired**, the emails will be classified accordingly. Otherwise, for demonstration purposes, **mock classification** will be applied to all emails.

## Email Retrieval

You can **adjust the number of emails to fetch using the dropdown menu** below the avatar section. Selecting a number will fetch that many emails. Use the paging options at the bottom of the page to navigate through the fetched emails. **Clicking the forward arrow** will increment the page number, **fetching the next set of emails**, while **clicking the backward arrow** will decrement the page number.

Besides, I have also added the minute functionality and made it's **Progressive Web App(PWA)** version available. You just have to look in the search bar of browser in desktop and click the desktop and plus button or click the three dot to the top right and click on Install the app, in case you are on smartphone.

### Enjoy exploring your classified emails!
